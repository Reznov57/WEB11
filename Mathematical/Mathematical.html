      <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
      <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
      <p>linear equation is any equation that can be writen in the form</p>
      <br />
      <figure class="phormula1"><span class="red21">ax+b=0</span></figure>
      <p>
        where <strong class="i">a</strong> and <strong class="i">b</strong> are
        real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the
        standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will
        not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an
        <strong class="i">x</strong> so don't get too locked into always seeing
        an
        <strong class="i">x</strong>
        there.
      </p>
      <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
      <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
      <figure class="phormula1">
        <span class="red21">ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</span>
      </figure>
      <p>
        where a, b, ¢ are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we
        don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
      </p>
      <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
      <p>π times the radius (r) squared:</p>
      <figure class="phormula1">
        <span class="red21">A=π x r<sup>2</sup></span>
      </figure>
      <p>or, when you know the diameter (D):</p>
      <figure class="phormula1">
        <span class="red21">A=(π/4)xD<sup>2</sup></span>
      </figure>
      <p>or, when you know the circumference (C):</p>
      <h2>Intersection</h2>
      <p>
        The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A 1B, is the set of all
        objects that are members of both the sets
      </p>
      <figure class="phormula1">
        <span class="red21">A∩B={x:x ∈ A and x ∈ B}</span>
      </figure>
      <p>
        That is, xis an element of the intersection A ∩ B if and only if xis
        both an element of A and an element of B.
